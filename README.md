# txtrefs

This is a collection of plain-text files for things
of which I often need to remind myself while using
the command line. Consider it a light, off-line version 
of howdoi or zeal that I can use in settings such as 
an airplane or a bar with wifi to which I don't want 
to connect.

The main design criteria is that each page is easily
readible in a vertically-split-screen terminal session
on a 14in laptop without having to scroll in any direction.
